# Rosalind Challenge
This repository contains my solutions, written in Python, to the [Rosalind Project.](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)  

Rosalind is a platform for bioinformatics programming questions and algorithms. It is a "joint project between the University of California at San Diego, Saint Petersburg Academic University, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Rosalind is partly funded by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor Award and a Russian Megagrant Award received by Pavel Pevzner." My repository contains my own solutions to Rosalind's problems, implemented in Python and listed by problem ID. Most of their coding questions are from the Python Village and Bioinformatics Stronghold pages, which I intend to complete in my free time over the summer as an exercise for programming with closer ties to biology.

All Python code in this project conforms to the PEP 8 style guide.
