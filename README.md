# Rosalind Challenge
This repository contains my solutions, written in Python, to the [Rosalind Project.](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)  

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics; visit the link above to their website for more information. Most of their coding questions are from the Python Village and Bioinformatics Stronghold pages, which I intend to complete in my free time over the summer as an exercise for programming with closer ties to biology.

All Python code in this project conforms to the PEP 8 style guide.
